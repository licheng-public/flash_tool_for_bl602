Two utilities are included.

1./ partiton maker
partition_maker.c is the source to build the executable for generating
partition from a partition configuration with .toml format. The parser
implementation is not official TOML compliant though. It would generate
the number of partition images named as $image_you_named@0x$address,
where the addresses are the ones specified in partition table of the
partition configuration file.

The usage is as follows:
make -f Makefile
./partition_gen -i part_config -o ./image_you_named

2./ partition dumper
dump_partition.c is the source to generate dumper.
gdb_inut and Makefile.dump is used for dump the field in partition table
from partition binary image.
It is used to dump and compare with the configuration source.

The usage is as follows:
INPUT=your_partition_binary make -f Makefile.dump
